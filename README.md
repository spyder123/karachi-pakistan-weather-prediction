## Advancing Weather Prediction with ML and Python

## Project background 
The challenge is to improve the accuracy and reliability of weather prediction in Karachi using machine learning techniques and Python programming. Despite advancements in meteorological models, predicting weather patterns in Karachi remains challenging due to its unique geographical location and complex atmospheric conditions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and Python programming, we aim to develop a predictive model that can effectively forecast weather conditions in Karachi with higher precision and longer lead times. This will enable better preparedness for extreme weather events, enhance resource allocation, and support decision-making processes for various sectors, such as agriculture, transportation, and disaster management.

## Project Goal

1. Develop a machine learning model using Python that can accurately predict weather conditions in Karachi.
2. Improve the lead time of weather forecasts, providing earlier warnings for extreme weather events.
3. Enhance the precision of weather predictions, reducing errors and increasing reliability.
4. Increase the understanding of the unique weather patterns and atmospheric conditions in Karachi.
5. Enable better resource allocation and planning for sectors such as agriculture, transportation, and disaster management.
6. Provide valuable insights and data-driven information to support decision-making processes related to weather-related risks and opportunities.
7. Evaluate and measure the performance of the developed model, comparing it with existing forecasting methods.
8. Continuously optimize and refine the model based on feedback and evolving weather patterns.
9. Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the meteorological community in Karachi by sharing the project's findings and methodologies.
10. Contribute to the advancement of weather prediction techniques and technologies, benefiting not only Karachi but also other regions facing similar challenges.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Have a Look at the [project structure](#project-structure) and [folder overview](#folder-overview) below to understand where to store/upload your contribution
- If you're creating a task, Go to the task folder and create a new folder with the below naming convention and add a README.md with task details and goals to help other contributors understand
    - Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
    - Create a README.md with a table containing information table about all contributions for the task.
- If you're contributing for a task, please make sure to store in relavant location and update the README.md information table with your contribution details.
- Make sure your File names(jupyter notebooks, python files, data sheet file names etc) has proper naming to help others in easily identifing them.
- Please restrict yourself from creating unnessesary folders other than in 'tasks' folder (as above mentioned naming convention) to avoid confusion.
